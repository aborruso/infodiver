TL;DR: Check out the [fineArts][Art], please.

Recollecting the days of my childhood. I liked painting. Transport, vehicles mostly went out of my pen, pencils and brushes. Then switched to skulls and anatomy topic in common. Also had pleasure to invent new types and even new alphabets with tricky typeface. I drew at every odd minute.

Then, I don\`t know why, I became an engineer. Upon this, anyway, Nature won out when I designed my graduation work presentation as fullscreen animation besides slides document as have been required. And even then I\`ve "missed the flash".

Back in 2014 I\`ve got the Arts course at Moscow Fine Arts School. That was exciting time. And after have lost in everyday here and there tasks. Time waxed on and finally I took a fancy for painting and drew some sketches, then colored some and made some pictures with water-color from scratch. Inspired!

To have a look, please, click on [arts][Art].

I appreciate any feedback about my pictures in twitter. Have a nice day!
